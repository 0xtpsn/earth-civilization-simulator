- `economy/` — production, trade, markets, pricing, shocks, sector models.
- `ideology/` — diffusion of beliefs, institutions, media channels, cohesion metrics.
- `worldgen/` — geography, era-aware environment reconstruction, resources, climate signals.
- `history/` — knowledge graph of facts/events, validity windows, sourcing and provenance.
- `timeline/` — reversible time-steps, snapshots, branching points, replay controls.
- `translation/` — language models, localisation rules, translation toggles, speech acts.
- `culture/` — cultural parameters (collectivism, power distance, norms) with drift over time.
