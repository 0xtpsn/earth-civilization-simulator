# Economy Engine

Macro and micro economic simulation — markets, production, trade, labor, and systemic cycles.

## Structure

- **`macro/`** — Aggregate economic indicators
  - GDP proxies
  - Inflation/deflation
  - Inequality metrics
  - Growth/decline cycles
  - Structural-demographic variables

- **`markets/`** — Goods and services markets
  - Supply and demand dynamics
  - Price discovery
  - Scarcity effects
  - Bubbles and crashes
  - Market clearing

- **`production/`** — Output generation
  - Production functions
  - Technology level constraints
  - Resource requirements
  - Labor productivity
  - Capital efficiency

- **`trade/`** — Exchange systems
  - Trade routes
  - Tariffs and barriers
  - War disruption
  - Comparative advantage
  - Currency exchange

- **`labor/`** — Workforce dynamics
  - Wages and compensation
  - Unemployment
  - Job mobility
  - Skill requirements
  - Labor markets

- **`shocks/`** — Economic crises
  - Wars and conflicts
  - Droughts and famines
  - Pandemics
  - Bank runs
  - Resource depletion

- **`forecasts/`** — Forward scenario generation
  - Signal-based predictions
  - Multiple plausible futures
  - Probability distributions
  - Sensitivity analysis

## Integration

Economy feeds:
- NPC incentives (wages, prices, opportunities)
- Institutional power (state revenue, elite wealth)
- Political stability (inequality, unemployment)
- Social dynamics (class structure, mobility)

## Design

Economy is treated as a "living organism" — markets respond to supply/demand, cultural attitudes, and external shocks. Historical patterns inform plausible trajectories.
