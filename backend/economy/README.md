# Economy Engine

Macro and micro economic simulation — markets, production, trade, labor, and systemic cycles.

## Structure

- **`macro/`** — Aggregate economic indicators
- **`markets/`** — Goods and services markets
- **`production/`** — Output generation
- **`trade/`** — Exchange systems
- **`labor/`** — Workforce dynamics
- **`shocks/`** — Economic crises
- **`forecasts/`** — Forward scenario generation

## Integration

Economy feeds:
- NPC incentives (wages, prices, opportunities)
- Institutional power (state revenue, elite wealth)
- Political stability (inequality, unemployment)
- Social dynamics (class structure, mobility)

## Design

Economy is treated as a "living organism" — markets respond to supply/demand, cultural attitudes, and external shocks. Historical patterns inform plausible trajectories.
