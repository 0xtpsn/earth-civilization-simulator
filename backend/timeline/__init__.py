Foundational Engine: Timeline (Time Travel & History Branching)

This is a foundational engine that makes the Universe deterministic and branchable.
It serves all phases by providing state snapshots, branching, and replay.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Foundational engine (serves multiple phases)
- Phase engines can import and use this
- This module should NOT import phase engines directly
- Provides: State snapshots, timeline branching, deterministic replay
