# Timeline Engine

Time travel, branching realities, snapshots, and replay — makes "go back and change history" real.

## Structure

- **`event-log/`** — Append-only action/event sourcing
- **`snapshots/`** — Periodic frozen world states
- **`branching/`** — Forked timelines
- **`replay/`** — Reconstruction

## Features

### Time Travel
- Jump to past or future dates
- Restore player state (wealth, injuries, legal status, reputation)
- Reset NPC memory appropriately
- Butterfly effect simulation

### Branching Timelines
- Each revisit creates a new branch
- Compare outcomes across branches
- Learn how different actions lead to different futures

### Replay
- Reconstruct any moment in history
- Fast-forward through time
- Step through events
- Debug simulation behavior
